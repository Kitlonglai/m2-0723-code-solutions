- What is destructuring, conceptually?
  assigning properties of an object to individual variables
- What is the syntax for `Object` destructuring?
  const or let followed by {} inside this is the property name first followed by a colon with the variable name on the right being assigned to the name of the object, with commas separating the properties
- What is the syntax for `Array` destructuring?
  const or let followed by [] inside of this is the new variable names assigned and commas separating the indexes
- How can you tell the difference between destructuring and creating `Object`/`Array` literals?
